this is a kahoot client.
hte servers are splited to 3:
1) the ../builders is java resource server to build the quizes.
2) the ../viewers is java server for the students that come to answer the quizes.
3) the ../authserver is java server a for signup and login.
the builders and viewers are resource services that trust the authserver token.
the servers are already exist and use maven.
the java servers are in ports:
REACT_APP_AUTH_API_URL=http://localhost:8079
REACT_APP_BUILDER_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
REACT_APP_VIEWER_API_URL=http://localhost:8081

I need to align the client to the servers ports and APIs.
the client is in port 3000.

please verify the following flows are working:
1) creator is dignup or login. in ../authserver 
2) creator and can see his quizes. in ../builders
2) creator can create a new quiz. in ../builders
3) creator can edit a quiz. in ../builders
4) creator can delete a quiz. in ../builders
5) creator can add quesetions to quiz. each question has 4 answers. in ../builders
6) creator can add a timer to the quiz. in ../builders
7) creator can add a title to the quiz. in ../builders
8) creator can add a description to the quiz. in ../builders
9) creator can add a image to the quiz. in ../builders
10) creator can open a quiz. in ../viewers
11) student can join the answering students on a specific quiz by inserting it number. in ../viewers
12) student can insert his name to be seen by creator after the quiz opened. in ../viewers
13) student can answer each question in the limited time. in ../viewers
14) for each question, when time ends, the right answer is shown and the points are added to the students and are shown in the creator screen. in ../viewers

** verify when API return 400 or 401 or 500, the client shows the right error message.
